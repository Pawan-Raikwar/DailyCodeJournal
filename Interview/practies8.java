/*You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the i-th stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x ≥ y. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed.

If x != y, the stone of weight y is destroyed, and the stone of weight x has new weight x - y.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
Return the weight of the last remaining stone.
If there are no stones left, return 0.

Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1  */
